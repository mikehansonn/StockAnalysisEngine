# StockAnalysisEngine

The focus of this project was to work with a few different Python APIs and learn more about the world of web development using Flask. The backend piece of this project is using yfinance to extract real-time data which is then processed to look for common trends that are seen in the world of finance. The current algorithm uses a fairly harsh grading system to ensure the picks are more accurate with little risk. Since this operation produces a decent amount of picks, I also designed another part that looks for stocks that are more risky to provide the user with a wide range.

This project has been a good experience and has given me a pretty good introduction to yfinance and built on my Flask knowledge along with general web-development skills. For the future of this project, I plan to add the option to receive personalized texts and emails based on specific user inputs and positive outliers that the algorithm produces.
